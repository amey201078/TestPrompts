Functional Design Document Creation Prompt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please reverse engineer the attached Functional Design Document (FDD) to generate a new, complete, and detailed FDD. Please follow these guidelines:

Deep Dive into Requirements:

Thoroughly analyze Section 1.1.2 (Scope) to enumerate all in-scope business processes, actors, and touchpoints.
Meticulously examine Section 1.1.4 (Description/Solution of Requirements) to extract every stated and implied requirement, including business rules, exceptions, integrations, and user interactions.
Ensure that no requirement or detail is missed—if in doubt, infer implied requirements based on context or best practices.
Expand and Structure the FDD:

For every requirement, describe the expected behavior, business context, and user experience in detail.
Structure the FDD into clear sections: Introduction, Scope, Actors/Roles, Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, User Stories, Integration Points, Reporting, Security, and any other relevant sections.
For each functional requirement, include:
Business rationale
Preconditions/triggers
Step-by-step user interactions
Expected system behavior
Edge cases and validation rules
Design Inventory Table:

Create a table with the following columns:
Feature
User Story
Components to be Generated or Extended
Type of Component (e.g., Entity, View, Workflow, Plugin, Integration, Dashboard)
Description
Each row should map a feature/user story to specific technical components required for implementation.
User Story Summary Table:

Create a summary table with columns:
User Story ID/Number
Summary/Title
Primary Actor
Goal
Acceptance Criteria
Ensure all critical user stories are included.
Comprehensive Coverage:

Review and incorporate relevant insights from other sections of the document (e.g., data model, integration, security, reporting, glossary).
For requirements or features not explicitly mentioned but implied or industry-standard, call them out as "Assumptions" or "Inferred Requirements".
Output Requirements:

The final FDD should be exhaustive, business-friendly, and ready for stakeholder review.
Use clear headings, bullet points, and tables for readability.
All requirements must be traceable to solution components.
Example Table: Design Inventory

Feature	User Story	Components to be Generated or Extended	Type of Component	Description
Customer Onboarding	As a user, I onboard a new customer...	Onboarding Entity, Main Form, Workflow	Entity, Form, Flow	Entity for onboarding, form for data entry, etc.
Example Table: User Story Summary

User Story ID	Summary	Primary Actor	Goal	Acceptance Criteria
US-01	Onboard new customer	Onboarding Agent	Capture and validate customer details	All required fields validated, KYC triggered
Instructions:

also perfom the below task as well

Task:
Analyze the attached requirement document for a Dynamics 365 CE project.

For each requirement, check if it is supported by Dynamics 365 CE Out-of-the-Box (OOB) features.
If not OOB, check if the requirement can be achieved through supported Customization (configuration, workflow, business rules, no-code/low-code customization).
If the requirement cannot be met OOB or via standard Customization, identify it as a gap or requiring custom development.
For each gap or ambiguity, raise clear, valid, and meaningful queries(should be multiple queries for ecah gap/ambiguity) for stakeholders to clarify or resolve.
Summarize the analysis in a table with the following columns:
Requirement ID/Reference
Requirement Description
OOB Supported (Yes/No)
Customization Possible (Yes/No)
Discrepancy/Gaps/Notes
Query for Stakeholders
Deliverable:
Provide the resulting table with all findings and queries for review.

Use the above structure and tables.
Ensure every requirement, even minor or implied, is described.
Reference and cover all relevant FDD sections.
Use business language where possible, but be specific and detailed.

TDD to Code Components Generation Prompt(Plugin/JS) - Assuming Solution Template is already available
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Analyze the attached Technical Design Document and create and add the C# class file(one for each plugin code block which starts with "//Plugin Logic - Start" word till "//Plugin Logic - End" with plugin template with namespace( add comments to the function header) and convert the plugin pseudocde into C# plugin code and put it in the plugin template(inherting the IPlugin and implementation of the interface and make sure that dont use generic logic to merge plugin template and pseudocde) and every variable is initialzied and no compilation issues should occur) and check for first occurence of non blank line above plugin code block for Plugin Name(Exclude numbers and spaces and "." and omit the words like "Plugin","Javascript","Azure Function","Power Automate","Workflow") and apply proper C# syntax 
2. Analyze the attached Technical Design Document and create and add the javaScript file(one for each javaScript code block which starts with "//JavaScript Logic - Start" word till "//JavaScript Logic - End" with JavaScript template with namespace( add comments to the function header) and convert the JavaScript pseudocode into JavaScript code and put it in the JavaScript template(make sure that every variable is initialzied and make sure that dont use generic logic to merge JavaScript template and pseudocde) and check for first occurence of non blank line above JavaScript code block for JavaScript Name(Only allow alpha characters and omit the words like "Plugin","Javascript","Azure Function","Power Automate","Workflow") and apply proper JavaScript syntax 

TDD To CE Metadata Components Generation Prompt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the attached technical design document for a Dynamics 365 CE solution, please perform the following:

1. Analyze & Generate Dataverse Schema JSON
Analyze the document and extract all entities (both standard and custom) and their attributes that need to be created or updated in Microsoft Dynamics 365 CE Dataverse.
Generate a JSON file including:
For each entity(include entities which are target entities for lookup and dont skip any entity):
Entity name, logical/schema name (with publisher prefix for custom), type (Out Of Box/Custom)
List of attributes(OOB and Custom) including option sets, and for each attribute:
Attribute name, logical/schema name (with publisher prefix for custom), data type, description, target entity (for lookup)
set referencingAttribute in case of lookup column to {publisher name}_{relationshipSchemaName}id
and set SchemaName of the relationship as {publisher name}_{ReferencingEntity}_{ReferencedEntity}.
2. Write Robust, Maintainable, OOP-Based C# Code
Write a single C# class file named DataverseGenerateMetadataHelper in the namespace DataverseGenerateMetadata with one facade public method Run.
The class should:
Accept the above JSON as a string parameter.
Use the Dynamics 365 CE Organization Service 
- Dynamically creates all entities in Microsoft Dataverse, ensuring:
    - Any entity(include both OOB and Custom entities) that is the target of a lookup is created before any entity that references it via a lookup.
    - Entities are created in an order that satisfies all lookup dependencies (use topological sorting or dependency analysis to determine this order and ignore circular dependencies).

- For each entity:
	- Check the existance of the entity by checking "Could not find an entity" or "does not exist" string in exception message
    - Create the entity if it does not exist in Dataverse and set schema name to logical name.
    - Check for existance of each non-lookup attribute in dataverse
	- Create the non-lookup if its not already exist
    - After the referenced entity/entities exist, add lookup attributes referencing them(if attribute is already present then ignore).
	-You should not create multiple attributes at once when creating the entity. 
	- primary name attribute should be created at the same time as the entity with the forat {publisher name}_{Name}. All other attributes, including lookups, must be created separately.
	- Please do not use RelationshipSchema as a custom class proprty
	- Please ensure funtion that creates attribute covers below data types except lookup
		1)Text
		2)Number
		3)Date
		4)Currency
		5)AutoNumber
		6)OptionSet
		7)GUID
		8)Boolean
	 and apply the correct format based upon the attached document 

The code must follow Microsoft best practices (naming conventions, synchronous processing, XML documentation, OOP, no console constructs).
Use standard switch case construct and strictly dont use recursive patterns
Use appropriate and accurate Relationship request(based on analyzed document) to create lookup attributes. Do NOT use CreateAttributeRequest for lookups and use NoCascade option for cascaded configuration(for delete use RemoveLink) and set SchemaName of the relationship as {publisher name}_<ReferencingEntity>_<ReferencedEntity>.
set ReferencedAttribute as primary key attribute of the target entity
Exception handling must be present for each method
show progress message on console after every step
The code should be easily extensible for more entities/attributes in the future.
Include a sample Run method demonstrating usage 
Output:

The JSON file as described above.
A single C# class file (DataverseGenerateMetadataHelper in DataverseGenerateMetadata namespace, with only one public facade method Run) that adheres to the above requirements.
Instructions for use:

Attach the technical design document as input.
Specify the publisher name to use for custom entities/attributes/solution.
Example usage:
"Given the attached TDD and the publisher name 'nf', please generate the required JSON schema and the C# class file as described above"
