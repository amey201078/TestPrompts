Functional Design Document (FDD)
Migration of Lotus Notes-Based Internal Transfer Processing to Dynamics 365 CE

1. Introduction
This document details the functional design for migrating the Internal Transfer Processing business process from the legacy Lotus Notes/Pega environment to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (D365 CE). The goal is to modernize, streamline, and secure the process, leveraging D365 CE’s features and extensibility.

2. Scope
In Scope:
* Automated ingestion and processing of daily internal transfer batch files.
* Exception handling workflows for failed transfers.
* Real-time and manual status monitoring.
* Integration with mainframe (file-based), Hostbridge (HTTP), and email systems.
* Administrative configuration and secure notifications.
* Reporting and audit trails.
Out of Scope:
* Processes unrelated to internal transfers.
* Enhancement beyond documented legacy functionality (unless specifically inferred).

3. Actors / Roles
Role NameDescriptionKey ResponsibilitiesInternal Transfer ProcessorOperations staff resolving transfer issuesInvestigate and resolve exceptionsApplication AdministratorManages configuration and monitoringConfigure settings, trigger batch processingSystem User (Automated)Automated agent for file ingestion/processingFile ingestion, batch automationIT SupportSupport error monitoring/escalationSystem error monitoringCompliance/Reporting UserAccesses reports, audit, and data extractsRun reports, review audit trails
4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Internal Transfer Data Ingestion
* Business Rationale: Automate daily capture of transfer requests, reduce manual entry.
* Preconditions/Triggers: Batch file available in FTP/SFTP location (triggered daily or on admin action).
* User Experience: Mostly automated; admin can view status or manually trigger.
* System Behavior:
o Connect to FTP/SFTP, retrieve and parse file, create transfer records.
o Prevent duplicate file ingestion (based on date/unique file identifier).
* Edge Cases/Validation:
o Invalid file format ? error notification, file ignored.
o Duplicate detection logic enforced.
4.2 Automated Transfer Processing
* Business Rationale: Increase efficiency, enforce business rules.
* Preconditions/Triggers: New transfer records created or batch process initiated.
* User Experience: Admin can monitor; processors notified for exceptions.
* System Behavior:
o Apply business rules, validate via Hostbridge.
o Set transfer status: Completed, Exception (with reason).
* Edge Cases/Validation:
o If Hostbridge/API fails or validation fails ? mark as Exception.
o Exclude Navchek accounts.
4.3 Exception Handling & Resolution
* Business Rationale: Ensure failed transfers are tracked and resolved.
* Preconditions/Triggers: Transfer in Exception status.
* User Experience:
o Processor accesses exception queue, views/edit details, retries or closes.
* System Behavior:
o Editable fields with audit trail.
o Reprocessing logic on update.
* Edge Cases/Validation:
o Field edit restrictions based on status/role.
o Only authorized users can resolve.
4.4 Monitoring & Views
* Business Rationale: Provide transparency and control.
* Preconditions/Triggers: User accesses dashboard/views.
* User Experience:
o Role-based dashboards for Completed, Exception, All Transfers.
o Filtering, sorting, export.
* System Behavior:
o Real-time updates post-processing.
4.5 Administrative Settings
* Business Rationale: Secure, centralized configuration.
* Preconditions/Triggers: Admin accesses settings.
* User Experience:
o Settings for FTP, Hostbridge, notifications.
* System Behavior:
o Secure credential storage, audit of changes.
4.6 Notifications & Alerts
* Business Rationale: Ensure stakeholders are informed.
* Preconditions/Triggers: Batch/job completion, error, or exception event.
* User Experience:
o Email notifications to configured recipients.
* System Behavior:
o Templated emails with dynamic details.
4.7 Integration with External Systems
* Business Rationale: Data enrichment and transfer execution.
* Integration Points:
o FTP/SFTP for batch ingestion.
o Hostbridge HTTP for validation/execution.
o Email for notifications.
4.8 Reporting & Audit
* Business Rationale: Support compliance and operational oversight.
* Preconditions/Triggers: User runs a report or audits activity.
* User Experience:
o Ability to run/download standard and ad-hoc reports.
* System Behavior:
o Field-level audit trails.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
* Performance: Batch jobs complete within business-defined windows; UI loads within 5 seconds.
* Availability: System accessible during business hours; batch jobs scheduled after hours.
* Security: Role and field-level access, encrypted integration endpoints.
* Audit: All critical actions and changes logged.
* Compliance: Data retention, privacy, and regulatory adherence.
* Scalability: Growth for increasing transfer volume.

* All business rules mappable to D365 workflows/plugins unless specified.
* Exception handling requires audit logging and traceability.
* No requirement for mobile/offline support unless specified.

15. Stakeholder Queries
1. File Ingestion:
o What is the formal data contract and error handling for the batch file?
o Is there a need for file reprocessing or rollback?
2. Business Rules:
o Which rules are expected to change frequently and should be admin-configurable?
o Do any rules require complex calculations beyond workflow capability?
3. Exception Handling:
o Which fields are editable on exception records and who can edit?
o What is the escalation path for unresolved exceptions?
4. Security:
o What encryption standards and audit requirements apply to integrations?
o Who is responsible for managing credentials and compliance?
5. Reporting:
o Are there regulatory requirements for reports or export formats?
o Should audit logs be accessible to all admin users or further restricted?
6. Retention:
o Required retention/archival periods and triggers for data purging?
7. Integration:
o Is Hostbridge accessible via HTTPS and are APIs documented?
o Required response times and error handling for integrations?
8. Performance/Scale:
o Expected/peak daily transfer volume?
o SLAs for batch completion and UI response times?
