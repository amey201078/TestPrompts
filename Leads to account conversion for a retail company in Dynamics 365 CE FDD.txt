1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the end-to-end process for creating Leads in the system and converting them into Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities. It defines functional requirements, data flow, validation rules, and scenarios.
1.2 Scope
* Lead creation from multiple sources (web forms, APIs, imports, etc.).
* Lead qualification and assignment.
* Conversion of Leads to Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities.
* Handling duplicates, errors, and edge cases.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Lead Creation
2.1.1 Data Input Sources
* Web Forms: Capture leads via website forms (e.g., "Contact Us").
* API Integration: Sync leads from third-party tools (e.g., marketing automation platforms).
* Manual Entry: Sales reps manually input leads.
* Bulk Import: CSV/Excel uploads for batch lead creation.
2.1.2 Mandatory Fields
* First Name, Last Name
* Email Address
* Company Name

2.1.3 Validation Rules

* Duplicate Check: Prevent duplicates using email/company name.
* Phone Number: Validate format (e.g., +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX).
2.1.4 Lead Assignment
* Assign leads to sales reps based on:
o Round-robin distribution.
o Territory (e.g., geographic location).
o Lead score (e.g., high-priority leads to senior reps).

2.2 Lead Conversion
2.2.1 Conversion Trigger
* Manual Conversion: Sales rep initiates conversion after qualifying the lead.
* Automatic Conversion: Triggered when lead meets criteria (e.g., lead score > 80).

o Merge Lead into existing Account and create new Contact.
* Scenario 3: Partial Conversion
o Missing critical data (e.g., email).
o Block conversion until data is added.
* Scenario 4: Error Handling
o System failure during conversion ? Rollback and notify user.

6. Scenarios and Edge Cases
6.1 Duplicate Handling
* System Action: Flag duplicates using fuzzy matching (e.g., "Intel Corp" vs. "Intel Corporation").
* User Action: Choose to merge or ignore.
6.2 Data Loss Prevention
* Preserve Lead data post-conversion (archive).
6.3 Internationalization
* Support phone/address formats for multiple countries.
6.4 Bulk Conversion
* Allow conversion of 50+ Leads in batch (async processing).

7. Reporting and Analytics
* Metrics:
o Lead-to-Account conversion rate.
o Time to convert (avg. days).
o Lead source effectiveness.

8. Security and Compliance
* GDPR: Allow Leads to request data deletion.
* Audit Trail: Log conversion history (who, when, changes).
