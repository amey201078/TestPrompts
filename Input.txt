3. Customization Analysis
3.1 Customizations & Configuration Steps
Customization
Description
Configuration Steps
PseudoCode/Logic
Custom Entity: Portfolio
Aggregate customer assets, track allocations; 1:N Account
1. Create "Portfolio" custom entity.
2. Add totalvalue, lastrevieweddate, accountid fields.
3. Establish 1:N relationship with Account. 

Custom Entity: KYC Document
Maintain KYC compliance docs, N:1 Account
1. Create "KYC Document" custom entity.
2. Add doctype, status, expirydate, accountid fields.
3. Establish N:1 relationship with Account. 

Business Rule: KYC Completion Required
Enforce mandatory KYC completion before opportunity closure
1. On Opportunity entity, create a business rule or plugin.
2. Block closure if not all KYC documents are completed. 
If user tries to close Opportunity:
?Check all related KYC documents for Account.
?If any are not complete, block the closure and display an error. 
Business Rule: KYC Escalation
If KYC Status is escalated, set related Opportunities to "On Hold"
1. On KYC Document entity, add workflow/plugin.
2. Update linked Opportunity status if KYC escalated. 
If KYC status is escalated:
?Find related Opportunities.
?Update Opportunity status to "On Hold".
?Notify Relationship Manager. 
Business Process Flow
Stage-gated process: Qualification ? KYC ? Proposal ? Approval ? Close
1. Create BPF on Opportunity.
2. Add stages, required fields, and automation. 
BPF advances only if required fields in stage are complete.
Opportunity cannot move to Close unless all prior stages, including KYC, are completed. 
Field-Level Security
Restrict sensitive fields (SSN, Portfolio Value) to privileged roles
1. Create security profiles.
2. Assign to sensitive fields and privileged roles. 

Custom Views & Dashboards
Active Portfolios, Pending KYC Approvals, etc.
1. Create filtered views.
2. Build dashboards with charts and KPIs.

7. PseudoCode for Key Logic

7.1 KYC Completion Plugin
If user attempts to close an Opportunity:
    Find all related KYC documents for the Account.
    If any KYC document is not marked as Complete:
        Block the closure and show error: "Complete all KYC before closing opportunity."
    Else:
        Allow Opportunity to be closed.

7.2 KYC Escalation Plugin
When KYC status changes to Escalated:
    Find Opportunities linked to the same Account.
    For each Opportunity:
        Set status to "On Hold".
        Notify the Relationship Manager of escalation.
  
7.3 Portfolio Value Calculation Plugin
On Portfolio update or allocation change:
    Sum all product allocations in the Portfolio.
    Update the Portfolio Total Value field.
    If the calculated value does not match expected, alert user.
       
7.4 Allocation Rule (JavaScript/Plugin)
On Opportunity Line update:
    Calculate total allocation percentage for all products.
    If total > 100%:
        Show warning and block save.
    If only valid financial products are allocated:
        Allow save.

7.5 PCF: Portfolio Allocation Chart

On Portfolio form load:
    Retrieve asset allocation data from Portfolio.
    Render donut/pie chart showing allocation percentages.
    Update chart in real time on allocation changes.
        
8. Security Considerations
* Customizations: Use field-level security for SSN, Portfolio Value. Enable audit logging for changes to sensitive data. Only authorized roles can edit or view sensitive fields.
* Integrations: All API calls use OAuth2 or certificate-based auth. Encrypt data in transit. Implement error and exception logging.
* Data Migration: Restrict migration access. Mask/anonymize PII in test loads. Validate all imported data and keep audit logs for changes.
* PCF Controls: Never store sensitive data in browser storage. Sanitize all user input and validate outputs. Review code for vulnerabilities and XSS.
