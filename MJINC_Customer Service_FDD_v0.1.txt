2.3 Detailed System Processes
2.3.1 Inquiry Management
* Inquiry Type/Sub Types

The Inquiry Type within the Inquiry entity serves as a classification to define the nature of the case. It helps categorize and prioritize different types of cases based on their characteristics. By specifying the issue or area of concern, the Inquiry Type enables more efficient case management. In the MJINC Solution, we have two Inquiry Types: Support Center and Customer Relations. 

The Inquiry Sub-type provides an additional level of classification beneath the Inquiry Type field. While Inquiry Type is used to broadly categorize inquiries (e.g., "Support Center" ,"Customer Relations"), the Inquiry Sub-type adds more detail to further refine the categorization. Essentially, the Inquiry Sub-type adds specificity to the Inquiry Type, allowing businesses to better manage different issues and ensuring more efficient resolution of cases.

* Inquiry Statuses
The Inquiry Status Reason field gives more detail and clarity about the current state of an inquiry. It helps customer support teams track the specific reasons or events that cause a change in the inquiry’s status, offering a better understanding of where the inquiry is in its process. Below are the Inquiry Status in the MJINC Solution 
Inquiry Status ReasonLogicNewWhen an Inquiry is being CreatedIn ProgressWhen an Inquiry is created and being Worked UponEscalatedWhen more attention is required, the case status will be updated to Escalated by the CS Rep Pending Response: CustomerWhen the CS Rep Requires input from Customer, the status will be updated to Pending Response: Customer Pending Response: Internal TeamWhen the CS Rep Requires input from Internal Team, the status will be updated to Pending Response:  Internal Team Response ReceivedWhen the CS Rep receives Response from Customer or Internal Team the status will be updated to Response Received
2.3.1.1    Inquiry Generation
Inquiry Intake
Inquiry Management: Intake
Source: Email, Portal, Phone, SMS, Website
Intakes: Support Center, Customer Relations, LEO, Credit <ME: Double check this>
Inquiry management is the process of efficiently tracking and resolving customer inquiries, concerns, and complaints. It involves managing customer interactions, assigning inquiries to the appropriate team members, and monitoring each inquiry until a satisfactory resolution is achieved. By providing timely and effective solutions, inquiry management ensures customer satisfaction and helps build long-term loyalty. A well-executed inquiry management system not only enhances customer retention but also strengthens a company’s reputation for delivering exceptional customer service. Inquiry can be created in three different ways Email, Portal and Phone across the Inquiry type Support Center and Customer Relations.
Inquiry Management: Create
Manually: User or Auto: Email, Portal
An inquiry can be created through three different sources: manually from the Inquiry section in the site map, automatically through a portal request, or by sending emails to the dedicated mailboxes of the Support Center, Customer Relations, Leo, or Credit.
* Manually Generated Inquiry
A customer service representative can connect with the customer and manually generate the Inquiry by collecting all the required data.
* From Portal
Inquiry creation from the customer portal allows customers to submit inquiries directly through a self-service portal, which then automatically generates a Inquiry in the system. When a customer logs into the Customer Service Portal, they can fill out a form to create a support request. This form typically includes fields like the Inquiry Title, description, Customer Inquiry Type and Customer Inquiry Sub Type. Once submitted, the system automatically creates an Inquiry in D365 CE, linking it to the customer's contact record. The customer then receives a confirmation email with the Inquiry number and can track the status of the Inquiry.

* From Email
Email to Inquiry refers to a process where customer emails automatically create Inquiry in the system. A customer sends an email to a predefined support email address. The system automatically converts the email into a new Inquiry, linking it to the customer's contact and account information, and stores the email as part of the Inquiry record. Based on predefined rules, the Inquiry can be routed to the appropriate team or queue for resolution.
Inquiries are routed to various Team based on the Power Automate and the Routing rule as below.

Note: If an Account specialist is associated to an Account for the Customer relation inquiry, then the inquiry will be assigned to the Account specialist
Inquiry: New Customer Inquiry using New Customer Placeholder
When an Inquiry must be created for a customer who is not in the system, the CS User Creates a new inquiry with Inquiry type as Support Center and Inquiry Sub Type as New Customer Inquiry then Customer field is auto populated with New Customer (Placeholder) Account, and it should be locked. A New field " Potential New Customer " (Lookup to Lead) will be populated as Mandatory Field in which the user can either create a new lead or select an existing lead to create an inquiry.
Inquiry: Complaint using No Customer Placeholder
When a Support Center Complaint does not have an associated customer, an inquiry can be created with the Inquiry type as Support Center and Inquiry Sub Type as Complaint. The customer field will be is auto populated with New Customer (Placeholder) Account
Inquiry: Complaint Inquiry

When an Inquiry is created with Inquiry type as Support Center and Sub type as Complaint, the customer will be auto set to No-Customer Placeholder Account and the Contact is set to Not required. However if users clear's the No-Customer Account and selects a valid customer then the Contact will be required.
Automated Inquiry Creation Confirmation Email
When an Inquiry is created from any source, an email is generated from a template automatically and sent to the customer contact on an Inquiry to notify the customer that an inquiry is created for their complaint/issues. 
Inquiry Preparation:
* Queues 
Queues are used to organize and manage incoming customer service requests, such as Inquiries, activities, or other work items. A queue acts as a holding area where work items can be stored until they are assigned to a customer service representative for resolution. Queues in Customer Service help streamline Inquiry management, ensure work is handled by the right people, and improve service efficiency.
Below are the List of Queues used in MJINC Solution 
* Define Business Process Flow
Business Process Flow offers a clear, step-by-step guide for resolving customer cases. It helps customer service representatives follow a structured approach, minimizing the need for extensive training for new team members. By capturing all relevant data at each stage of the process, it enhances efficiency and boosts customer satisfaction.
Note:- We are not using Business Process Flow in Customer Workspace App.

* Manage Related Inquiries
Inquiries can be linked using connections. This feature enables users to associate inquiries with each other. To create a connection, users must navigate to the "Related Inquiries" tab on the case form and generate a connection record.




* Inquiry Similarity Rules
Based on the Inquiry Title the AI model learns from the summary and details of all resolved and active cases. It then provides knowledge article suggestions to active cases and similar case suggestions to both active cases and ongoing conversations. The model can process up to 1 million most recent cases. The Similar Inquiry will be Suggested based on the Inquiry Title on the Smart Assist Pane upon opening an Inquiry.

The Inquiry Similarity Rule must be turned on from the customer Admin center.  


2.3.1.2    Inquiry Routing

Inquiry Management: Basic Routing:
Routing Rules:
Inquiry routing ensures that inquiries are directed to the correct queue, user, or team. The customer service representative can either take ownership of the inquiry or it can be automatically assigned for further investigation to resolve the customer's inquiry. Routing rules are configured under the Billing Inquiries Routing for all teams.
Inquiry will be routed based on the below scenario’s 
Support Center:
The Inquiries created from portal routes to the Support Center queue, with the owner being the Support Center. Emails sent to the intake mailbox are also routed to the Support Center queue, with the owner assigned to the Support Center. For phone inquiries, the inquiry is manually created and remains with the original owner, assigned by the user, without any routing.
Customer Relations:
If the account has an Account Specialist, inquiries from the portal and email (intake mailbox) will be assigned to the Account Specialist, with the owner listed as the Account Specialist or the user. For phone inquiries, the inquiry is manually created with no routing and remains with the original owner, as assigned by the user. In inquiries where the account does not have an Account Specialist, inquiries from the portal and email will be routed to the queue, with the owner being Customer Relations. Similarly, phone inquiries are manually created, with no routing, and stay with the original owner, as created by the user.
Credit Team:
Emails from the intake mailbox(credit) are routed to the Credit Team, with the owner assigned to the Credit Team. Please note that this routing does not involve the Account Specialist, as they are not considered in this process.
LEO Team:
Emails from the intake mailbox (LEO) are routed to the LEO Team, with the owner assigned to the LEO Team.
2.3.1.3    Inquiry Execution
Manage Inquiries:
Effective document and communication management is vital for maintaining accurate inquiry records and ensuring clear communication with customers. This feature allows CS Reps to capture relevant documents, record and classify notes, and create and assign tasks related to customer Inquiries. Additionally, it includes basic email templates for consistent communication. By organizing and managing documents and communications efficiently, CS Reps can provide better service and maintain a comprehensive inquiry history.

* Document Management
* Notes and Communications
* Task Management
* Communication Preferences

Inquiry: Customer Communication:
Email Activity:
Agent Script: Script / Macro (Create Email Activity)
Agent Script Name: Inquiry Agent Script
Agent Macro Name: Open Email Activity (with Template)
The purpose of this Agent Macro is to streamline the process of creating Email Activities for an inquiry. When a Customer Service Representative wants to create an Email Activity from an inquiry, they can do so efficiently by simply clicking on the Agent Script in the productivity pane and selecting "Open Email Activity (with Template)." Upon selecting the macro, the email will automatically populate with a template, the "From" field will be filled with the appropriate mailbox based on the inquiry type, and the "To" field will be populated with the contact's email address.
Portal Comments:
Customer can respond to a clarification raised by a CS Rep through Portal Comments. Customer will have the ability to Add a comment against the inquiry from the portal and the same will reflect in CRM as Portal Comment.
Pending Inquiry: Response Received:
When a case is in the Pending Response: Customer or Pending Response: Internal status, an Incoming Portal Comment or an Email associated with the Inquiry is will update the inquiry status reason to Response Received to reflect that a response has been received from the customer or internal team.
Merge Inquiries
Merging related inquiries in Customer Service helps combine duplicate or similar inquiries, making it easier to manage cases more efficiently. This is particularly useful for handling duplicate cases or when multiple cases are created for the same issue, helping to streamline case management and avoid confusion.
 
 
The merged cases will automatically be closed and linked under Merged Cases in the primary case.
 
Cancel Inquiries
When an CS Rep cancels an Inquiry, they can choose to set the Inquiry status to either Cancelled or Merged. By default, the status is set to Cancelled, and this should remain unchanged when manually cancelling a Inquiry. In the case of viewing multiple Inquiry, an CS Rep can select two or more Inquiry to merge. In this scenario, the Inquiries that are cancelled during the merge will automatically have their Status Reasons updated to Merged.
Reassign Inquiries
Reassigning inquiries refers to the process of changing the owner or the team responsible for handling a specific inquiry. This helps ensure that the right person or team is working on the inquiry based on their expertise, availability, or workload.
Inquiry: Escalation (ME: Action: Business Rules, Description)
The CS Rep will have the ability to Escalate Inquiry when more attention is required. CS Rep will update the Escalated field on the inquiry form. Once the Escalated field is updated to Yes, Escalated Reason becomes Mandatory and CS Rep updates the reason. The Escalated by is auto populated and Inquiry status is updated to Escalated and inquiry can be reassigned to correct Rep if required.
Research Case Inquiry
Work Order Lookup
The user will be able to create a new work order or link an existing one using the Work Order lookup. Any work order created for the customer associated with the inquiry will appear in the lookup. By selecting the work order, the user can view its status.

Invoice Lookup
The user will be able to link to an existing invoice using the Invoice lookup. Invoices created for the customer associated with the inquiry will be shown in the lookup. By selecting the invoice, the user can view its status in the Invoice Related Tab.
       
2.3.1.4    Inquiry Closure
Convert Inquiry to Knowledge Article
Upon resolving an Inquiry, users should not be able to auto Convert an inquiry to a Knowledge Article.
Inquiry Resolution
Inquiry resolution in customer service refers to the process of verifying that a customer's Case or inquiry has been successfully resolved or addressed. This typically involves reviewing the customer's inquiry record or Case to ensure that all necessary actions have been taken and that the customer is satisfied with the resolution. User should only have Resolved resolution status to select. User should not have the Problem Solved and Information Provided as resolution status.
Automated Case Resolution Confirmation Email
When an Inquiry is marked as resolved and when the resolution status is updated an email is generated from a template automatically and sent to the customer contact on an Inquiry.
Close an Inquiry
Inquiry resolution refers to the process of confirming that a customer’s issue or Inquiry has been effectively addressed. This usually involves reviewing the customer's inquiry record to ensure that all necessary steps have been completed, and that the customer is satisfied with the outcome.
Send Survey to Customer: (Customer Voice)
Once an Inquiry is resolved, a survey will be sent to Customer post 3 days of resolving the inquiry. The customer will receive the Survey link through email and the customer will be able to respond to the survey based on their experience.
Survey will be sent to the customer based on the below criteria 
* Is Feedback Survey Field in inquiry sub type of the inquiry must be set to Yes
* A Contact must be present on the Inquiry with a valid Email id
* Surveys Field under General Preference tab of the contact must be set to Allow
Reopen a Closed Inquiry
When an Inquiry is closed and a customer replies to the Inquiry Resolution Email, the system is designed to automatically reopen the inquiry. This functionality ensures that any incoming email activity related to a closed inquiry is promptly recognized, triggering the Inquiry to reopen and update its status to "Response Received.
2.3.2 Customer Management

5 Reports and Dashboards
Dashboards and reporting provide valuable insights into the performance of customer service teams. This feature includes various dashboards for Billing Analysts, CS Reps, and team leads, allowing them to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and manage their work effectively. By providing real-time data and visualizations, dashboards help teams track progress, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance service delivery.
Dashboards:
The following table outlines the various dashboards available in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (D365 CE) and their respective purposes.

6 Application Security
Figure 20 MJINC BU Structure






6.1 Security Design Approach
The desired approach for D365 Application Security is a Layered Role Approach, as described below.

Folder Location: Security
Multiple Security Roles
* Users/Teams can be assigned more than one role.
* Users/Teams assigned to multiple roles will have a combination of privileges and access levels from all assigned roles.
* They are granted the least restrictive access level for each record type and privilege.



Business Unit:
In Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (D365 CE), Business Units are fundamental to the role-based security model. Therefore, it's crucial to organize Business Units in a hierarchical structure. As a best practice, we aim to use as few Business Units as possible to simplify management and maintain clarity.

Role-Based Security:
Role-Based Security focuses on grouping a set of privileges that define the responsibilities or tasks a user can perform.
Record Based Security: 
* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete
* Assign
* Share
Teams: Setting up Teams in CRM is based on the functional requirements, the business unit hierarchy, and the security roles to be configured. If there is a need for a group of users across various business units to collaborate on a record, teams can be created in CRM, and the records can be shared with the team.

Field Level Security: Field level security restricts access to specific fields for designated users and teams.

<Action Item: ME: Add Field Level Security Profile for Customer Service>
6.2 Business Unit 
D365 Business Units (BUs) are used to segment data across different groups. For the D365 Customer Service Solution, there is no specific requirement to segment data. In our design, both Customer and Sales teams need access to all Accounts, Contacts, etc. Functionally, we plan to accommodate Customer Service users within a single BU.
The following is the current Business Unit Structure to Support the Customer Service Solution:
* Root BU
o MJINC Safety BU
* Users are assigned at the MJINC Safety BU
* Teams are assigned at the MJINC Safety BU

6.4 Teams

6.5 Field Based Security
The D365 Customer Service Solution includes two column-level security profiles: 
* Customer Service - Support Center
* Customer Service - Customer Relations. 
The Support Center profile grants users the ability to update Account/Work Order Instructions, while the Customer Relations profile allows users to update Billing Instructions. 
Note this works alongside the Sales Solution Business Rule (Java Script), to lock all Account fields when Account is Approved.

8 Customer Service: Solution Reference Data
8.1 Customer Service: Master Data
8.1.1 Inquiry Types and Sub Types
Inquiry Types and Sub Types are used to classify inquiries. This section outlines the functional design for managing Inquiry Types and Sub Types. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive guide on how Inquiry Types are structured, stored, and utilized to enhance the efficiency of handling customer and internal inquiries. The design ensures dynamic, data-driven changes to accommodate evolving business needs.
Inquiries have two sets of Inquiry Types Internal Inquiry Types/Sub Types (MJINC CE Users) and Customer Facing Inquiry Types/Sub Types (Customer Contacts in Portal).
Key Points:
* Dynamic Data-Driven Changes: The table allows for dynamic updates as needed to adapt to changing business requirements.
* Hierarchical Structure: Inquiry Types and Sub Types are organized hierarchically to streamline the inquiry management process.
* Customer and Internal Differentiation: Separate fields for internal and customer-facing inquiries ensure clarity and appropriate handling.
* Feedback Integration: The inclusion of feedback surveys helps in gathering customer insights and improving service quality.
* Ownership and Responsibility: Clearly defined ownership ensures that inquiries are visible to the appropriate teams.

Core Field List for Inquiry Types:
1. Inquiry Type
* Defines the primary category of the inquiry.
2. Parent Inquiry Type
* Drives the hierarchy of Inquiry Types.
* Inquiry Types have a blank Parent (Internal Type).
* Inquiry Sub Types have a Parent Value (Internal Sub Type).
3. Internal Inquiry Type
* Maps Internal Inquiry Type Value from Portal Inquiries.
4. Is Customer Portal
* Indicates if the items are customer-facing (Yes/No).
* Customer Inquiry Types and Sub Types work similarly to Internal Types/Sub Types but are customer-friendly and shown in the portal with a 'Yes' in Is Customer Portal.
Is Feedback Survey
* Indicates if a Customer Voice Survey is sent for the Inquiry Types.
Owner
* A team that determines which Inquiry Types are for Support Center vs. Customer Relations.

8.1.2 Account Placeholders
Account Placeholders are used in scenario where an actual customers cannot be used. In this solution, we are using two Account Placeholder.
New Customer Placeholder - It is populated to route a new customer inquiry to the New Customer Onboarding Process, after collecting some basic information from the new potential customer.
No Customer Placeholder - When a Support Center Complaint does not have an associated customer, an inquiry can be created with the Inquiry type as Support Center and Inquiry Sub Type as Complaint.
8.1.3 Category and Subject
* Category
In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Categories in Knowledge Articles (KA) are used to organize and classify knowledge content, making it easier for agents and customers to search for relevant information. By assigning categories to knowledge articles, you help ensure that users can quickly find the information they need by filtering or searching through various topics.
* Subject 
Dynamics 365 Customer Service includes a subject organizational structure that lets you group knowledge base articles. By using the subject hierarchy, you can classify service cases to quickly provide service to your customer.
