Functional Design Document (FDD)

1.1.1.1. Introduction
This Functional Design Document (FDD) outlines the requirements for the Sales Call and Journey Planning system. The system is designed to optimize sales call scheduling, journey planning, and reporting for Account Sales Managers (ASMs) and their respective teams. It incorporates automated and manual processes, integration with external systems, and mobile/offline capabilities to ensure seamless operations and enhanced productivity.

1.1.1.2. Scope
1.1.1.2.1. In Scope
• Automated creation of sales call schedules based on customer tiering.
• Manual creation and adjustment of sales calls by ASMs.
• Journey planning, including route optimization and integration with navigation tools.
• Management reporting for tracking planned and actual calls.
• Integration with CRM, Outlook, and mobile navigation apps.
• Mobile and offline access for ASMs.
1.1.1.2.2. Out of Scope
• Development of new CRM platforms (only integration with existing Dynamics CRM).
• Custom development of navigation tools (only integration with existing apps like Google Maps).
• Non-sales-related activities (e.g., non-customer-related tasks).

1.1.1.3. Actors/Roles
• Account Sales Manager (ASM): Responsible for managing customer relationships, scheduling calls, and executing journey plans.
• Regional Sales Manager (RSM): Oversees ASMs and reviews their journey plans and performance.
• Regional Sales Director (RSD): Provides strategic oversight and ensures alignment with business goals.
• Sales Director (SD): Monitors overall sales performance and reporting.
• System Administrator: Manages system configurations, integrations, and user access.

1.1.1.4. Assumptions and Inferred Requirements
• Assumptions:
• ASMs will have access to mobile devices with internet connectivity for real-time updates.
• Customer tiering data will be available and updated regularly in the CRM system.
• Integration with Outlook and navigation apps will be seamless and require minimal user intervention.
• ASMs will adhere to the minimum and maximum daily call requirements.
• Inferred Requirements:
• The system must account for holidays, customer availability, and ASM planned leaves when creating schedules.
• Journey plans must include walking, public transport, and private transport options based on region-specific needs.
• Visual representation of journey plans must be intuitive and easy to interpret.
• Offline functionality must ensure data synchronization once connectivity is restored.
