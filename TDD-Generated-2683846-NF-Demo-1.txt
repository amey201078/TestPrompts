It is based on the Functional Design Document (FDD) and provides a comprehensive guide for developers, architects, and stakeholders to understand the technical architecture, design considerations, and implementation approach.
1.1.1.2. Terms, Acronyms, and Definitions
• Exception: A transfer record that fails automated processing and requires manual intervention.
• Hostbridge: An external service platform for real-time data validation and transaction execution.
• Internal Transfer Processor: A user responsible for investigating and resolving exceptions.
• Agent: Automated processes for parsing files, processing records, or handling background logic.
1.1.1.3. Purpose and Intended Audience of This Document
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed technical design for the implementation of the Exception Handling and Integration solution. The intended audience includes:
• Dynamics 365 CE Developers
• Solution Architects
• Business Analysts
• Quality Assurance Teams
• Project Stakeholders
1.1.1.4. Solution Overview
The solution involves exception handling for internal transfers, integration with Hostbridge services, and the development of custom entities, workflows, and views in Dynamics 365 CE. It ensures robust error handling, real-time data validation, and compliance with business and regulatory requirements.

1.1.2. Design Considerations
1.1.2.1. Key Technical Decisions
• Use of custom entities and workflows to handle exceptions and integrate with Hostbridge services.
• Implementation of role-based security to ensure data privacy and compliance.
• Use of plugins and Power Automate for file intake and processing logic.
• Real-time API integration with Hostbridge for data enrichment and validation.
1.1.2.2. Assumptions and Dependencies
• Hostbridge APIs and FTP endpoints are available and documented.
• Sample data and file layouts will be provided by stakeholders.
• Security and compliance requirements will be validated before go-live.
• The system will support future integration points and scalability.

1.1.3. Technical Architecture
1.1.3.1. System Architecture
The system architecture includes the following components:
• Dynamics 365 CE as the core platform for managing exceptions, workflows, and reporting.
• Hostbridge services for real-time data validation and transaction execution.
• FTP server for daily file intake and processing.
• Email notification system for exception alerts and escalations.
1.1.3.2. Data Flow
1. File Intake:
• Daily transfer files are ingested via FTP.
• Records are parsed and created in Dynamics 365 CE.
2. Exception Handling:
• Failed records are flagged as exceptions.
• Users review and resolve exceptions via custom views and forms.
3. Hostbridge Integration:
• API calls are made to validate and enrich data.
• Responses are processed, and records are updated accordingly.
4. Notification and Reporting:
• Exception notifications are sent to relevant users.
• Reports are generated for operational tracking and compliance.

2.3.4. Power Automate with Steps
2.3.4.1. Exception Notification Flow
• Flow Name: acc_ExceptionNotificationFlow
• Trigger: When a new exception record is created.
• Steps:
1. Trigger the flow when a new record is created in the "Exception" entity.
2. Retrieve the details of the exception record (e.g., Transfer ID, Error Type, Assigned Processor).
3. Check if the "Assigned Processor" field is populated.
• If yes, proceed to Step 4.
• If no, assign the exception to the default processor and update the record.
4. Send an email notification to the assigned processor with the exception details.
5. Log the notification in the "Notification Log" entity.
2.3.4.2. Hostbridge API Retry Flow
• Flow Name: acc_HostbridgeAPIRetryFlow
• Trigger: When a Hostbridge API call fails.
• Steps:
1. Trigger the flow when an error is logged in the "Error Log" entity.
2. Retrieve the error details (e.g., API Name, Error Message, Retry Count).
3. Check if the retry count is less than the maximum allowed retries.
• If yes, proceed to Step 4.
• If no, flag the exception as "Unresolvable" and notify IT support.
4. Retry the API call using the same parameters.
5. If the API call is successful, update the related transfer record and mark the error as resolved.
6. If the API call fails again, increment the retry count and log the error.
2.3.4.3. Daily File Processing Flow
• Flow Name: acc_DailyFileProcessingFlow
• Trigger: Scheduled to run daily at a specified time.
• Steps:
1. Connect to the FTP server and download the daily transfer file.
2. Parse the file and create transfer records in Dynamics 365 CE.
3. For each record, validate the data fields.
• If validation fails, create an exception record.
• If validation succeeds, proceed to Step 4.
4. Call Hostbridge APIs to enrich the transfer data.
• If any API call fails, create an exception record.
5. Mark all successfully processed records as "Completed".
6. Send a summary email to the admin with the processing results (e.g., Total Records, Exceptions, Completed).
2.3.4.4. Exception Escalation Flow
• Flow Name: acc_ExceptionEscalationFlow
• Trigger: When an exception record remains unresolved for more than 48 hours.
• Steps:
1. Trigger the flow when an exception record's "Last Updated Date" exceeds 48 hours.
2. Retrieve the details of the exception record (e.g., Transfer ID, Assigned Processor).
3. Notify the assigned processor and their manager via email.
4. Update the exception record to indicate that it has been escalated.
5. Log the escalation in the "Escalation Log" entity. # 1. Plugins and Pseudo Code
