4. Functional Requirements





4.1 Customer Onboarding
Business Rationale:
Ensure a seamless, compliant onboarding experience for new banking clients.
Preconditions/Triggers:
* New customer request received via branch, portal, or referral.
User Interaction Steps:
1. RM initiates onboarding from Account or Contact.
2. System presents onboarding form (risk profile, relationship type, required docs).
3. User enters details; system validates required fields.
4. KYC process triggered on save/submit.
Expected System Behavior:
* Save record only if required fields are present.
* Trigger KYC workflow automatically.
* Assign onboarding task to RM and Compliance Officer.
Edge Cases/Validation:
* Show error if required fields missing.
* Block onboarding if duplicate customer detected.









4.2 Regulatory Compliance (KYC/AML)
Business Rationale:
Automate compliance checks and reduce manual errors.
Preconditions:
* Onboarding in progress or periodic review due.
User Interaction Steps:
1. Compliance Officer reviews KYC document checklist.
2. Uploads or verifies documents; system tracks status.
3. If KYC status escalated, system sets related Opportunities to "On Hold".
Expected System Behavior:
* Mandatory completion of KYC before opportunity closure.
* Audit trail for all changes and approvals.
Edge Cases/Validation:
* Notification to RM if KYC delayed or escalated.
* Deny opportunity closure if KYC incomplete.


4.3 Portfolio Management
Business Rationale:
Aggregate and monitor customer assets for better service and regulatory reporting.
Preconditions:
* Customer onboarded and assigned products.
User Interaction Steps:
1. Portfolio Manager views/creates Portfolio from Account.
2. Adds/updates product allocations.
3. System aggregates total value, calculates risk, and updates dashboards.
Expected System Behavior:
* Accurate calculation and display of portfolio metrics.
* Restrict access to sensitive fields (e.g., Portfolio Value).
Edge Cases/Validation:
* Alert if portfolio review overdue.
* Block deletion if linked to active opportunities.



4.4 Opportunity Product Allocation
Business Rationale:
Ensure correct allocation of financial products to sales opportunities.
Preconditions:
* Opportunity created and linked to Account.
User Interaction Steps:
1. RM adds Opportunity Line Items (products) to Opportunity.
2. Specifies quantity, allocation percentage.
3. System validates totals, enforces allocation rules.
Expected System Behavior:
* Cannot exceed 100% allocation.
* Only valid financial products selectable.
Edge Cases/Validation:
* Warning if allocation percentage not matching expected total.




4.5 User Management & Security
Business Rationale:
Protect sensitive information and ensure proper role segregation.
Preconditions:
* User assigned to a role.
User Interaction Steps:
1. Admin assigns roles to users.
2. User logs in and sees only permitted data and actions.
Expected System Behavior:
* Field-level security for SSN, Portfolio Value.
* Role-based access for records and actions.
Edge Cases/Validation:
* Audit log on access or changes to sensitive data.












4.6 Dashboards and Reporting
Business Rationale:
Provide actionable insights to users and management.
Preconditions:
* Data available in system.
User Interaction Steps:
1. User opens dashboard (e.g., Portfolio Overview, KYC Compliance).
2. System displays charts, KPIs, and alerts.
Expected System Behavior:
* Real-time update of metrics.
* Drill-down to underlying records.















5. Non-Functional Requirements
* Performance: Dashboards and forms must load within 3 seconds for up to 100 concurrent users.
* Security: All data encrypted at rest and in transit; audit logs enabled.
* Compliance: GDPR/HIPAA compliance enforced.
* Availability: 99.9% uptime for critical business hours.
* Usability: Forms optimized for minimal data entry; tooltips and error messages provided.
