Detailed Description of the Customization
This document details the technical design for implementing the customer onboarding process in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (CE) for a retail bank, based on the provided FDD. It covers custom entity creation, system configuration, integration, migration, and security, following best practices for Dynamics 365 CE and Dataverse. 
Configuration Steps
1. Set up security roles, email, and mobile configuration as per FDD.
2. Customize out-of-the-box (OOB) entities (Contact, Account, Lead, Opportunity, Case, Activity) as required.
3. Create custom entities with publisher prefix nf: nf_onboardingtask, nf_onboardingchecklist, nf_customerfeedback, nf_identityverification, nf_documentmanagement.
4. Configure forms, views, business rules, and relationships for each entity.
5. Set up integration points and data migration jobs.
6. Implement required PCF components, plugins, and JavaScript (if applicable).
Entities Overview
Design Notes: 
* Option Sets are used instead of new entities where only static values are required (e.g., task status, feedback type).
* The default name property is used when storing entity descriptions or names, avoiding redundant attributes.
* Entity Ownership: Customer-related entities are User-owned. Checklist and Task-type entities are Organization-owned for global access. Refer to each entity s details.

Code Snippets (Pseudocode)
7.1 KYC Completion Plugin

//Plugin Logic - Start

When an Identity Verification record is updated and Status changes to 'Passed':
    - Check if Document Link is present
    - If not present, throw an error "Verification document required"
    - If present, mark KYC/AML Result as "Complete"
    - Optionally, trigger email to Onboarding Manager

//Plugin Logic - End
        
7.2 Data Validation Workflow

//Workflow Logic - Start

On Data Import:
    - For each imported record
        - Validate mandatory fields are present
        - Check for duplicate customers (by email/ID)
        - If validation fails, move record to error queue

//Workflow Logic - End
        
Integration Strategy
1. Email Integration 
o Systems Involved: Dynamics 365 CE, Exchange/Office 365
o Data Flow: Synchronize emails, send onboarding notifications
o Method: Server-side synchronization, EWS API
o Security: OAuth authentication, encrypted transport
o Error Handling: Retry on failure, admin notifications
2. Mobile App Integration 
o Systems: Dynamics 365 CE, Dynamics 365 Mobile
o Data Flow: Real-time sync of onboarding data
o Method: Native mobile app connectivity
o Performance: Use minimal fields, enable offline sync
3. Data Import 
o Systems: Legacy CRM/Core Banking, Dynamics 365 CE
o Data Mapping: Contacts, Accounts, Leads ? CE entities
o Method: Data Import Wizard, Dataflows, SSIS
o Security: Only admin can import, data encrypted at rest
o Error Handling: Validation, error logs, reconciliation
Data Migration
* Source Data Systems: Legacy CRM, Core Banking, Excel/CSV files
* Data Cleansing & Transformation: Remove duplicates, standardize names, validate email/ID fields
* Migration Approach: Data Import Wizard for simple data, SSIS/Dataflows for large/complex sets
* Validation & Reconciliation: Post-migration reports, sample checks, error queue for failed records
PCF Component Evaluation
* Onboarding Progress Bar: Visualizes onboarding task completion for a customer 
o Purpose: Show % complete of onboarding steps
o Inputs: Task list, completion status
o Outputs: Progress visual, completion events
o Reference: Microsoft PCF Documentation
* Document Previewer: Inline display of uploaded documents in Document Management entity
Plugin Evaluation & Pseudocode

//Plugin: Data Validation on Import - Start

For each imported entity record:
    If mandatory fields missing, set status = Error, log details
    If duplicate found, mark as duplicate, prevent import

//Plugin: Data Validation on Import - End
        

//JavaScript: Onboarding Task Form - Start

On form load:
    If Status = Completed, lock all fields except Notes

//JavaScript: Onboarding Task Form - End
        
Security Considerations
* Customizations: Set field-level security on sensitive data (e.g., KYC/AML fields), enable auditing for all critical attribute changes.
* Integrations: Use secure authentication (OAuth), restrict integration user permissions, encrypt all data in transit and at rest.
* PCF Controls: Validate and sanitize all input/output, avoid exposing sensitive data in visual controls.
* Plugins/Workflows: Handle exceptions gracefully, do not return sensitive error messages to users.
