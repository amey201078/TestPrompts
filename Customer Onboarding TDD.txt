3.1 Customizations & Configuration Steps
CustomizationDescriptionConfiguration StepsPseudo-Code/LogicOnboarding Task EntityTracks specific tasks in onboarding. Custom fields for assignment, status, linkage to checklist.1. Create "Onboarding Task" entity.
2. Add fields: onboardingtaskname, statuscode, ownerid, onboardingchecklistid, duedate.
3. Enable auditing.
4. Enable for mobile. Onboarding Checklist EntityStores all checklist items. Used for gating task completion.1. Create "Onboarding Checklist" entity.
2. Add fields: name, allitemscompleted.
3. Relationship: 1:N to Onboarding Task. Identity Verification EntityStores KYC/AML status and verification date.1. Create "Identity Verification" entity.
2. Add: kycstatus, amlstatus, verificationdate.
3. Relate to Contact/Account. Document Management EntityStores uploaded customer documents.1. Create "Document Management" entity.
2. Add: documenttype, documenturl, expirydate.
3. Relate to Contact/Account. Business Rule: Onboarding Task Required FieldsEnsure required fields are filled if task is active.1. Create business rule on Onboarding Task.
2. Required: onboardingtaskname, ownerid, statuscode if status is 'Active'. If Task Status is Active and any required field is empty, show error "Required field missing". Business Rule: Due Date ValidationEnsure Due Date is not in the past.1. Business rule on Onboarding Task.
2. If duedate < Today, show error. If Due Date is before today, display "Due Date cannot be in the past". Workflow: Email NotificationSend email when task is created/completed.1. Workflow on Onboarding Task creation/completion.
2. Trigger email to assigned user/manager. On task create or complete, send email to assigned user or manager. Workflow: Approval for Onboarding TaskCustom workflow for multi-level approvals.1. When status = Pending Approval, trigger approval process.
2. On approval, set status to In Progress.
3. On reject, notify creator. If status is Pending Approval, send approval request. On approval, set In Progress. On rejection, notify creator. Plugin: Task Completion GatingPrevent task status "Completed" unless all checklist items are done.1. Register plugin on Onboarding Task 'Update' for status change.
2. If status set to Completed, check checklist items. On status change to Completed, if checklist not all done, block and show error. JavaScript: Required Field ValidationEnforce required fields dynamically on Onboarding Task form.1. Add JS to Onboarding Task form OnSave event.
2. Check required fields, show notification if missing. On form Save, if required fields missing, prevent save and alert user. 3.2 Role and Privileges Matrix

Pseudo-Code for Key Logic
7.1 Plugin: Prevent Task Completion Without Checklist

When Onboarding Task status is changed to Completed:
    Retrieve related Onboarding Checklist
    If not all checklist items are marked as done:
        Block status change and show an error message to the user: 
        "All checklist items must be completed before marking task as Completed"
        
7.2 JavaScript: Validate Required Fields on Save

On Onboarding Task form Save:
    For each required field (Task Name, Assigned To, Status):
        If field is empty:
            Prevent save and show notification: "Required field missing"
        
7.3 Workflow: Approval for Onboarding Task

When Onboarding Task status is set to Pending Approval:
    Send approval request to manager
    If approved:
        Set status to In Progress
    If rejected:
        Notify creator and set status to Rejected
        
7.4 Azure Function: KYC Integration

On KYC check request:
    Receive API call with customer info
    Call core banking/KYC/AML API with provided details
    Parse result
    Update Identity Verification entity in D365 CE
        
8. Security Considerations
* Customizations: Field-level security for sensitive fields; audit logging enabled on key entities.
* Integrations: Use OAuth2, encrypt traffic, log all API interactions, handle errors gracefully.
* Data Migration: Limit migration access, mask/obfuscate PII in test loads, validate all imported data, maintain audit trail.
* PCF Controls: Never store sensitive data in browser, sanitize user input, review for vulnerabilities.
