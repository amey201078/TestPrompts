5. Functional Requirements
5.1 Sales Call Management
5.1.1 System-Created Calls Based on Tiering (CRM1.1, CRM4.1)
* Business Rationale: Ensure all customers are contacted at the right frequency according to business value.
* Preconditions: Customers have current tiering; last meeting date is available.
* User Interaction: Tiering factors auto-assigned; ASM notified of planned calls.
* Expected System Behavior:
o System calculates next call dates per customer using tier logic (e.g. Tier 1 = bi-weekly).
o ASM’s journey plan and Outlook calendar are updated.
o Customers lacking tier or meeting date are flagged for review.
* Edge Cases/Validation: Default scheduling for missing data, error notifications for incomplete records.
5.1.2 Manually Created/Amended Calls (CRM1.2, CRM4.2)
* Business Rationale: Enable flexibility for ASMs to manage ad hoc or prospect calls.
* Preconditions: User has permissions; customer/prospect exists in CRM.
* User Interaction: ASM adds/edits calls in UI; justification provided for overrides.
* Expected System Behavior:
o Validates for conflicts, minimum/maximum calls per day, working hours.
o Updates CRM and Outlook accordingly.
* Edge Cases/Validation: Exceeding call limits prompts warning; calls outside working hours blocked.
