Functional Design Document (FDD): Exception Handling and Integration for Internal Transfer Processing

1. Introduction
This FDD describes the end-to-end requirements for the Internal Transfer Exception Handling and Integration solution, based on deep analysis of the provided Functional Design Document (FDD) for the "INTERNAL TRANSFERS FOR ACAPS" application. The document is structured to provide exhaustive coverage of business processes, actors, integration points, features, user stories, and touchpoints, with clear mapping to technical components and Dynamics 365 CE capability analysis.

2. Scope
* In Scope:
o Exception handling for internal transfers
o All core and supporting features described in "Features", "Journey 2: Exception Handling", and integration sections
o Hostbridge service integrations
o User roles, security, reporting, and data model
* Out of Scope:
o Processes external to internal transfer management unless they are integrated
o Non-ACAPS related workflows

3. Actors & Roles
Actor/RoleDescriptionInternal Transfer Processor (Isabel)Operations staff who reviews, investigates, and resolves exception cases in internal transfersApplication Administrator (Adam)Responsible for daily file intake, monitoring, triggering automated agents, and configurationSystem/AgentAutomated background processes (agents) that parse, process, and update transfer recordsIT/System SupportReceives error notifications and supports technical troubleshootingMainframe System (ACAPS)Source of daily internal transfer fileHostbridge ServicesProvides real-time data lookup and transfer execution APIs
4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Exception Handling
4.1.1 Business Rationale
Exception handling is critical for ensuring that failed or problematic internal transfer requests are promptly identified, reviewed, and resolved to maintain operational integrity.
4.1.2 Preconditions & Triggers
* New transfer records are processed by the automated agent.
* Any record not processed successfully is flagged as an exception.
4.1.3 User Interactions & System Behavior
* Step 1: Exception Identification
o System parses daily file and creates transfer records.
o Any validation, data, or processing error sets the status to "Exception" and writes an error reason.
* Step 2: Exception Review
o Processor opens the "Exceptions" view to see all failed records.
o Detailed error message and all transfer data are visible.
* Step 3: Exception Investigation & Correction
o Processor reviews, corrects data, adds notes, or marks record as rejected.
o May trigger a reprocess or resolve manually.
* Step 4: Resolution
o On successful correction, record is moved out of exceptions (to completed/archived).
o If not resolvable, record is marked appropriately (e.g. "Manual Handling", "Rejected").
* Validation Rules & Edge Cases
o Only users with appropriate roles can update exception status.
o Audit trail is maintained for all changes.
o System prevents duplicate or incomplete data submission.
4.1.4 Edge Cases & Validations
* System must prevent duplicate processing of the same file/date.
* Data fields must be validated for completeness and correctness.
* Exception records must be visible until resolved.

4.2 Integration Features
4.2.1 Hostbridge Service Calls (as Use Cases)
For each Hostbridge call, a separate use case is defined:
Hostbridge ServiceUse Case TitleBusiness Context & BehaviorgetMbrNameRetrieve Member NameFor each transfer, retrieves the member's name using the Access Number. If unsuccessful, flags exception.getAccountTypeRetrieve Account TypeRetrieves account type for debit account, using Access Number and Debit Account. Flags exception on failure.getAppIDValidate Loan Account-AppID LinkChecks if loan account is still linked to original AppID. Flags exception if mismatch.getFullPaymentAmountRetrieve Full Payment AmountLooks up mandatory payment amount for loan. Exception on failure.getDueDateRetrieve Loan Due DateFetches due date for loan account; exception if not found.performITExecute Internal TransferCore process to execute/set up internal transfer. On failure, sets exception and captures error message.getDraftObtain Draft Number (if used)(Potential, currently commented out) Checks for draft number to prevent duplicate ITs.For each:
* Precondition: Transfer record ready for enrichment/execution.
* User/System Steps: Automated agent constructs request, calls Hostbridge API, processes response.
* Expected Behavior: On success, data is updated in record; on failure, exception is flagged with error details.
* Edge Cases: Unreachable Hostbridge, timeouts, malformed data, partial response—handled as exception.

4.3 Application Configuration
* Administrators can manage FTP, Hostbridge, and notification settings via "Application Settings".
* Only authorized users can update configuration.
* Audit trail of changes is maintained.

4.4 Reporting & Views
* "Completed", "Exceptions", and "All Documents" views for tracking status.
* Exception reports show reason, user actions, and resolution status.
* Ad hoc reporting for operational needs.

4.5 Security
* Role-based access to views, actions, and data.
* Sensitive data masked or access-restricted.
* Audit logging for all changes and exception handling.

4.6 User Experience
* Clear, actionable error messages for exceptions.
* Intuitive navigation between views.
* Real-time update of views upon data change.

4.7 Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
* Availability: Daily file processing; user access during business hours.
* Performance: Batch processing and UI must complete within agreed timeframes.
* Scalability: Support future growth in volume/users.
* Business Continuity: Backup, recovery, and disaster recovery in place.
* Compliance: Data privacy, retention, audit trails.
* Reliability: Robust error handling, notification, and data integrity.

Gaps/Queries (Examples for Stakeholder Clarification)
* How should exceptions be prioritized or assigned (manually, auto-routing)?
* What is the expected SLA for exception resolution? Is escalation automatic?
* What is the preferred method for file intake if FTP is not feasible in the cloud?
* What error handling is required for Hostbridge outages—should process pause, retry, or flag exceptions?
* What fields must be masked, and what is the policy for data retention?
* Are there any regulatory or audit trail requirements for configuration changes?
* What are the notification/escalation rules for critical system errors?
* Is any part of exception handling time-sensitive (e.g., must be resolved within X hours)?
* What is the volume/scale expectation for exception records?
* Are batch job results to be visible on a dashboard or only via email?

13. Additional Sections
13.1. Assumptions
* All integration endpoints (Hostbridge, FTP) are available and documented.
* Stakeholders will provide sample data and file layouts as needed.
* Security and compliance requirements will be validated prior to go-live.
13.2. Inferred Requirements
* System should support future expansion to new integration points.
* Exception handling UI should be mobile/tablet responsive.
* All user actions in exception handling should be logged for compliance.
* Manual data correction should be reversible or tracked with audit trail.
