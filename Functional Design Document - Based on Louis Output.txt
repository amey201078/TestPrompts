Functional Design Document (FDD)
Migration of Lotus Notes-Based "INTERNAL TRANSFERS FOR ACAPS" to Dynamics 365 CE

1. Introduction
This FDD outlines the migration and redesign of the "INTERNAL TRANSFERS FOR ACAPS" application, currently based on Lotus Notes, to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (D365 CE). It leverages analysis from legacy artifacts and business process documentation to ensure a comprehensive, business-aligned solution.

2. Scope
* In Scope:
o Ingestion and processing of daily internal transfer batch files.
o Automated and manual exception handling.
o User experience for monitoring, investigating, and resolving internal transfer requests.
o Integration with external systems (FTP, Hostbridge services, email).
o Administrative settings and system notifications.
o Reporting, audit, and security.
* Out of Scope:
o Non-ACAPS transfer types.
o Enhancement beyond documented legacy functionality (unless specified as an assumption).

4. Functional Requirements
4.1. Internal Transfer Data Ingestion
* Business Rationale: Automate the capture of internal transfer requests from mainframe-generated files.
* Preconditions/Trigger: Daily batch file is available in FTP location.
* User Interactions: None (system-initiated), with admin override/manual trigger possible.
* Expected System Behavior:
o System fetches file, parses each record, and creates a Transfer record.
o File uniqueness is checked; duplicate files (same date) are not reprocessed.
* Edge Cases/Validation:
o Invalid or missing file terminates job with notification.
o Duplicate file detection.
4.2. Automated Transfer Processing
* Business Rationale: Reduce manual effort, ensure standardized processing.
* Preconditions/Trigger: New transfer records created or batch job initiated (scheduled or by admin).
* User Interactions: Manual trigger possible by admin.
* Expected System Behavior:
o For each transfer, apply business rules (validations, data enrichment via Hostbridge, calculations).
o Set status to Completed or Exception with error details.
* Edge Cases/Validation:
o Any failed Hostbridge call or data validation sets Exception status with clear error message.
o Navchek accounts are excluded from processing.
4.3. Exception Handling & Resolution
* Business Rationale: Ensure resolution of failed transfers; comply with financial controls.
* Preconditions/Trigger: Transfer record in Exception status.
* User Interactions:
o Processor reviews Exception queue, opens record, investigates, updates/corrects data, and retries or closes.
* Expected System Behavior:
o Allow edit of certain fields, record audit trail.
o Allow status updates, comments, and retrial of processing.
* Edge Cases/Validation:
o Only authorized users can update exception records.
o System tracks all changes for audit.
4.4. Monitoring & Views
* Business Rationale: Operational transparency, workload management.
* Preconditions/Trigger: User accesses dashboard or views.
* User Interactions:
o View Completed, Exception, and All Transfers, filter and sort as needed.
* Expected System Behavior:
o Role-based access to views.
o Real-time updates post-processing.
4.5. Administrative Settings
* Business Rationale: Centralized, secure configuration management.
* Preconditions/Trigger: Admin accesses settings.
* User Interactions:
o Admin views/edits FTP, Hostbridge, notification settings.
* Expected System Behavior:
o Secure storage of credentials.
o Change log for settings.
4.6. Notifications & Alerts
* Business Rationale: Ensure timely awareness of processing status/errors.
* Preconditions/Trigger: Batch completion, error occurrence.
* User Interactions:
o Stakeholders receive email alerts.
* Expected System Behavior:
o Configurable recipient lists.
o Error details included in messages.
4.7. Integration with External Systems
* Business Rationale: Data enrichment and transfer execution.
* Details:
o FTP for file ingestion.
o Hostbridge HTTP services for member/account validation, calculations, and transfer execution.
o Email for notifications.
4.8. Reporting & Audit
* Business Rationale: Compliance, operational oversight.
* Preconditions/Trigger: User runs/report or audit is required.
* User Interactions:
o Generate/download reports.
o Access audit trails.
* Expected System Behavior:
o Standard and ad-hoc reports.
o Complete field-level audit trails.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
* Performance: Batch processing must complete within business-defined windows. UI must load lists in <5 seconds.
* Availability: System available during business hours; batch jobs outside user hours.
* Security: Role-based access, PII protection, secure integrations (SFTP/HTTPS).
* Audit: All changes tracked, especially exceptions.
* Compliance: Adhere to data privacy, retention, and audit standards.
* Scalability: Support volume growth (X% per year).
* Maintainability: Configurable rules, minimal code for changes.

14. Assumptions & Inferred Requirements
* All file imports will be via secure protocol (SFTP/HTTPS); fallback to FTP only if justified.
* Only authorized admin users can modify application settings.
* All business rules can be mapped to D365 workflows or plugins unless otherwise specified.
* Exception handling requires audit logging and change tracking.
* Outbound integrations (Hostbridge, email) are accessible from Dynamics 365 environment.
* No requirement for mobile/offline support unless specified.

15. Open Queries for Stakeholders
1. File Ingestion:
o What is the full, formal data contract for the mainframe batch file?
o How should the system handle partially processed or corrupt files?
o Are there scenarios where a file may need to be reprocessed?
2. Business Rules:
o Which business rules are subject to frequent change, and should they be configurable?
o Are there any rules that require complex calculations not feasible in no-code workflows?
3. Exception Handling:
o Should users be able to edit all fields on exception records, or only specific ones?
o What is the process for reprocessing exceptions—manual trigger, automatic on edit, or both?
o What is the escalation path for unresolved exceptions?
4. Security:
o What are the required encryption standards for in-transit and at-rest data?
o Who manages credentials for integrations, and what compliance standards apply?
5. Reporting:
o Are there regulatory or audit requirements for report formats or data export?
o Should audit logs be accessible to all admin users, or restricted?
6. Retention:
o What is the minimum/maximum retention period for transfer records and associated logs?
o What triggers data archival or purging?
7. Integration:
o Are all Hostbridge services accessible via HTTPS with documented APIs?
o What is the expected response time and error handling for each integration?
8. Performance/Scale:
o What is the expected/peak volume of daily transfers?
o Are there SLAs for batch completion and user UI response times?
