6. Code Snippets & Plugin Pseudocode
6.1 Plugin: Appointment Rescheduling

//Appointment Rescheduling Plugin Logic - Start
On Appointment update, if Start or End date/time is changed:
    - Require nf_reschedulereason to be populated.
    - Log the reason and previous date/time in a custom field or audit log.
    - Trigger email notification to customer with new details.
    - If email fails, retry and alert ASM.
//Appointment Rescheduling Plugin Logic - End
        
6.2 Power Automate: Auto-Scheduling Flow

//Flow Logic - Start
On Account Tier update:
    - Calculate next call date based on tier rules.
    - Create Appointment activity for ASM.
    - Set nf_calltype, nf_objective, and link to Account.
    - If required data missing, flag for review.
//Flow Logic - End
        
6.3 Power Automate: Walk-in Suggestion Flow

//Flow Logic - Start
On Appointment cancellation:
    - Identify nearby prospects (geocode proximity).
    - Suggest available prospects for walk-in.
    - Allow ASM to accept/reject suggestion.
//Flow Logic - End
        
6.4 Business Rule: Only One Primary Home Location

//Business Rule Logic - Start
On nf_UserLocation save:
    - If nf_isprimary = Yes, set nf_isprimary = No for all other locations for the same user.
//Business Rule Logic - End
        
7. Integration Strategy
7.1 Dynamics 365 CRM & Outlook Calendar
* Systems: Dynamics 365 CE, Microsoft Outlook
* Data Flow: Appointment entity syncs to Outlook Calendar (subject, start, end, location, attendees)
* Method: Native Dynamics 365-Exchange integration (server-side sync)
* Security: OAuth, role-based access
* Error Handling: Sync failures logged, user alerts
* Performance: 3-5 minute sync window
7.2 Navigation Apps Integration
* Systems: Dynamics 365 CE, Google Maps/Waze/Bing Maps (mobile)
* Data Flow: Deep-link journey plan with route/waypoints
* Method: URL deep-linking from Dynamics mobile app
* Security: Device-level app permissions
* Error Handling: Fallback to manual entry if app not installed
* Performance: Instant, device-dependent
7.3 Data Import/Migration
* Source: Legacy CRM, HR/ERP (for holidays, home locations)
* Method: Data Import Wizard, Power Query, custom ETL scripts
* Data Cleansing: Validate addresses, deduplicate, ensure geocoding
* Validation: Pre/post migration reports, sample record checks
8. Data Migration Approach
* Source Systems: Legacy CRM, HR/ERP, Excel/CSV
* Transformation: Map fields to new schema, standardize option set values, geocode addresses
* Migration Tools: Data Import Wizard, Power Query, KingswaySoft (if needed)
* Validation: Use test imports, reconcile record counts, spot-check data
* Reconciliation: Export post-migration data, compare with source, resolve discrepancies
9. PCF Component Evaluation
9.1 Journey Map Visualization
* Purpose: Display daily/weekly journey plan on an interactive map with route, stops, and transport info
* Inputs: List of appointments (with geocodes), transport mode
* Outputs: Map with route, stops, directions, travel time
* Example: Microsoft Map PCF Sample
9.2 Appointment Directions Button
* Purpose: Button to open navigation app with pre-loaded route
* Inputs: Appointment address/geocode
* Outputs: Deep-link URL
* Example: PCF Gallery: Google Maps Directions
10. Security Considerations
* Customizations: Use role-based security, field-level security for sensitive data (e.g., home locations)
* Integrations: OAuth for Outlook, device permissions for navigation apps, encrypted data in transit
* Data Migration: Restrict access to migration tools, audit logs for all changes
* PCF Controls: Validate input, prevent data leakage, respect user permissions
* Audit: Enable auditing for key entities and attributes
