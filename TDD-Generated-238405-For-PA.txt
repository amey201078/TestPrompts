1. Introduction
1.1 General Information
This Technical Design Document (TDD) outlines the technical implementation details for the Sales Call Journey Planning Solution. It provides a comprehensive view of the system architecture, data flow, and design considerations to ensure alignment with the Functional Design Document (FDD).
1.2 Terms, Acronyms and Definitions
Refer to the glossary section in the FDD for definitions of terms such as ASM, Tier, Prospect, Journey Plan, and others.
1.3 Purpose and Intended Audience of This Document
The purpose of this document is to provide technical stakeholders, including developers, system architects, and IT support teams, with the necessary details to implement the solution. It serves as a guide for development, testing, and deployment.
1.4 Solution Overview
The solution leverages Dynamics 365 CE, Power Automate, and integration with Outlook and navigation apps to automate and optimize sales call journey planning for ASMs. It includes features such as automated scheduling, route optimization, mobile access, and reporting.

2. Design Considerations
2.1 Key Technical Decisions
• Use of Power Automate for automated workflows such as call scheduling and validation.
• Integration with Outlook for calendar synchronization.
• Implementation of custom entities for home locations and holiday management.
• Use of PCF for interactive journey map visualization.
2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
• All ASMs have access to Dynamics 365 CE and Outlook on mobile devices.
• Customer tiering data is accurate and updated in real-time.
• Geocoded addresses are available for all customers and prospects.
• Navigation app integration is device-dependent and requires pre-installed apps.

3. Technical Architecture
3.1 System Architecture
The solution is built on Dynamics 365 CE, utilizing its native capabilities for entity management, workflows, and integrations. Customizations include plugins, Power Automate flows, and PCF components. The architecture supports mobile and offline access, ensuring usability for field sales teams.
3.2 Data Flow
• Data flows between Dynamics 365 CE, Outlook, and navigation apps.
• Automated workflows handle call scheduling, validation, and rescheduling.
• Real-time synchronization ensures data consistency across systems.
• Offline changes are queued and synced upon reconnection.
