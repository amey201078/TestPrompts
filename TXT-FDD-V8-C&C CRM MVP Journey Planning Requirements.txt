Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-05-27

1. Introduction
This Functional Design Document (FDD) details the solution for automating and optimizing sales call journey planning for Account Sales Managers (ASMs) using Dynamics 365. The design has been reverse-engineered from the provided requirements document and expands each requirement into actionable, stakeholder-ready components. The document ensures traceability, business alignment, and technical clarity for all stakeholders involved in the implementation and review process.

2. Scope
2.1 In Scope
* Automated and manual creation of sales call schedules for ASMs
* Tier-based customer segmentation driving call frequency and route
* Management of prospect and customer calls within a journey plan
* Integration with Outlook Calendar and mobile navigation applications
* Route and journey optimization considering holidays, working hours, and locations
* Visual mapping and reporting of journey plans
* Management and reporting of re-scheduling, cancellations, and walk-ins
* Mobile and offline access to journey plans
* Management reporting on planned and actual calls
* System and user-driven next call creation
* Data synchronization with Dynamics CRM and Outlook
2.2 Out of Scope
* Custom mobile application development outside Dynamics 365 mobile capabilities
* Integration with non-supported or legacy CRM/ERP systems
* Direct integration with third-party navigation apps not offering APIs
* Data migration from legacy systems (unless specifically stated)
* Custom development for advanced AI-based route optimization
* Voice assistant integration
* Real-time GPS tracking of ASMs

3. Actors/Roles
* Account Sales Manager (ASM): Primary user, manages journey plans, schedules/reschedules calls, reviews maps, and updates call outcomes.
* Line Manager (RSM, RSD, SD): Reviews journey plans, filter views by ASM, monitors performance.
* CRM System: Automates scheduling, integrates with Outlook and navigation apps, enforces business rules.
* Prospect/Customer: Receives calls/appointments, interacts through scheduling and confirmations.
* System Administrator: Configures system parameters, manages integrations and user roles.
* IT Support: Handles issue resolution, manages offline/online synchronization.
* Outlook Calendar: Used for scheduling, syncing, and availability checks.
* Navigation Apps (Google Maps, Waze, Bing Maps): Provides route guidance.

4. Assumptions and Inferred Requirements
No.Assumption/Inferred RequirementSource/JustificationA1All ASMs have Outlook and Dynamics 365 access on mobile devices.Implied by mobile/Outlook integration.A2Customer "Tier" data is maintained and updated in CRM.Implied by tier-driven scheduling.A3Working hours, holidays, and home locations are stored or accessible in CRM or integrated systems.Referenced in journey planning.A4All customer/prospect addresses are geocoded or can be mapped for navigation.Required for route planning and mapping.A5Data privacy and retention are managed per organization policy.Implied in reporting notes.A6ASM can manually override system plans where needed.Implied in manual call creation and amendments.A7Communications for rescheduling are only via Email.Requirement text.A8Offline functionality is limited to essential features (view, basic edit).Best practice for mobile/remote work.A9Each ASM can have multiple home locations but only one primary for journey start/end.Implied in requirements.A10Integration with navigation apps depends on device capability and app availability.Industry standard.A11All call activities (planned, completed, rescheduled) are auditable for reporting.Implied by reporting requirements.
