When I need to get a summary of a CI Case

Then I can use the AI Summary/ribbon button to create one
CI Agent Intake (Medium) - AU Service Tab updates
*Priority - Medium*

*Step #1*: As a CI User creating a CI Case with subtype ‘Critical Incident’ in Australia Instance

When a CI Case is created, I want a Work Order to be automatically created and relate it to the Case.

The Work Order should be of Incident type ‘Trauma Consultation’ and pull the required fields from the case

The Service Location for the Work Order should be +the same as the Service address on the root account+

!image-20250625-133247.png|width=814,height=536,alt="image-20250625-133247.png"!



The Work Order should have Scoping and Intake Hours (under Service Tab) auto populated to 1h  and all other fields on the service tab should be blank

and it should be automatically booked to the Dummy Provider called _Case Open (Scoping)_ {color:#bf2600}_(GUID) - Environment Variable must be created_{color}

*Step #2*: As a CI User on a CI Case in the Australia Instance

When I create Work Orders of type ‘Critical Incident’, 

* I want the Scoping and Intake Hours (under the Service Tab) to be left blank
* I want Delivery Hours  (under the Service Tab) to be auto-populated to the time difference between the Client Requested Start Time and the Client Requested End Time (i,e, Start time is 8AM and End time is 5pm, the delivery hours would be 9h)

*Step #3*: As a CI User on a CI Work Order of Type ‘Critical Incident’ in the Australia Instance

When the Work Order is scheduled 

If the Service is In Person

* I want the Travel Hours (under the Service Tab) to be autopopulated from the booking’s Duration (Yet to be build as part of New Scheduled Board - [[AVAN-59] TH365 | CI | New Schedule Board Appointment Confirmation Book Button Behaviour - JIRA|https://workivate.atlassian.net/browse/AVAN-59] )
* Else I want the Travel Hours to be set to 0h



Note: To develop this story, we need to use the Environment Variable ‘Region’
*AC#1:* Given I am a CI User in the Australia instance

When I create a CI Case

Then a Work Order is automatically created in the related Work Orders

And the Type is set to ‘Trauma Consultation’ 

And the Service Location should be the service address of the Root Account

And in the Service Tab, the Scoping and Intake hours should be set to 1h

And the Work Order should be scheduled to the Dummy Provider called Case Open (Scoping)



*AC#2:* Given I am a CI User on a CI Case with Sub-Type Critical Incident in the Australia instance

When I create a Work Order of Type ‘Critical Incident’

Then, in the Service Tab, I want the Scoping and Intake hours to be left blank

And I want the Delivery Hours to be auto-populated with the difference between Client Requested Start Time and Client Requested End Time



*AC#3:* Given I am a CI User on a Work Order in the Austrlia Instance

When a Work Order of type ‘Critical Incident’ is scheduled

Then, if the service in In Person, I want the Travel Hours (under the Services tab) to be auto-populated based on the booking’s Duration

Else, I want the Travel Hours to be set to 0h
CI Agent Intake (Low) - Case Timeline updates
*Priority - Low*

As a CI user on a CI case

I want to see the following updates on the CI Case timeline

So that I can easily find the information I need

* I should see ‘Created On’ at the top of a note record
* I should see ‘Created By’ below ‘Created On’
* I should see ‘Modified On’ at the bottom of a note record
* ‘Created by’ should no change when another user modifies the note (It should stay as the original user who created the note)
* The notes should be displayed in order of ‘Created on’ (Most recent to less recent)
* Only the Created By user or a user with the CI Leadership role should be able to modify a note

*AC#1:*

Given I am a CI User on a CI Case

When I look at a note on the timeline

Then I should see Created On and Created by at the top of the note

And Modified On at the bottom of the note



*AC#2*

Given I am a CI User on a CI Case

When I modify a note on the timeline

Then Created By remains as the user who created the note



*AC#3*

Given I am a CI user without the CI Leadership security role on a CI Case

When I try to modify a note on the timeline

Then I can only modify the notes I created and not notes created by other CI Users



*AC#4*

Given I am a CI Leadership user on a CI Case

When I try to modify a note on the timeline

Then I can modify notes created by me AND notes created by other CI Users

Enable Parent Account for CSMP
{color:#0747a6}*Narrative:*{color}
As a CI Specialist, I want the system to generate a CSMP intake form that I can share with a customer (when they have signed a contract for CSMP with the CSM), so that we have a method to intake CSMP requests from the client.
 
CSMP Fields for Parent Account
{color:#0747a6}*Narrative:*{color}
As a CI Specialist, I want to be able to mark that a parent account is now eligible for CSMP services (CSM has sold the account CSMP services), so that I know which accounts can receive CSMP services and I can generate the intake form specific to that CSMP account.
*GIVEN* - I am a CI Specialist
*WHEN* - I navigate to a parent account organization
*THEN* - I see the following field on the account record:

|{color:#ffffff}*Field*{color}|{color:#ffffff}*Field Type*{color}|{color:#ffffff}*Validation/Logic*{color}|{color:#ffffff}*Description*{color}|
|CSMP Enabled|Two Option Set (Radio)|No
Yes
-
WHEN this field is toggled to "Yes" THEN the CSMP Intake form is populated with a Customer Voice link that capture the 'Root Account' in the case following submission|Used to generate the CSMP Intake form link|
|CSMP Intake Form Link|Text (URL)| |Contains the CSMP intake form link|

The fields should be displayed in the account form as shown below.  There should be a new section created called ‘CSMP’.  The field should be displayed in the following order:


* CSMP Enabled
* CSMP Intake Form

If the Contact ‘Preferred Language’ is “French”
Send Authorization Email to a Set of Authorizers - US
{color:#0747a6}*NARRATIVE:*{color}
As a CI Coordinator, I want to be able to trigger an email to authorizers for a special contracted organization when I receive a case request, so that I can quickly collect an approval to proceed with the case.

{color:#0747a6}*SOLUTION NOTES:*{color}

Must be built in CI-J
Will leverage custom triggers in CI-J.  Environment variables are required for supporting Power Automates.

----

{color:#0747a6}*ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA*{color}
*GIVEN* - I am a CI Coordinator
*WHEN* - a case has been created where ‘Case Type’ = “Service” AND ‘Case Sub-type’ = “Critical Incident” where the associated organization has an authorizer contact and the requestor is NOT the authorizer
*THEN* - I want the ability to send an automated email to all active authorizers for the organization (account).

To do this, I should see a toggle called ‘Send Authorization Email’ that should send a templated email to all contacts related to the organization where their Account-Contact Role - ‘Role' value is ‘Authorizer’ AND the status of the contact is ‘Active’ AND status of the Account-Contact Role ‘Status’ = “Active”.

This toggle should be placed in the top of the communication section of the case and only displayed when the associated organization has at least one contact that has a Contact-Account Role with a ‘Role' = “Authorizer'.

When the ‘Send Authorization Email’ toggle (Yes/No) is set to “Yes”, THEN the following email is sent to all related authorizer contacts and the CSMs that is responsible for the organization AND the ‘Authorization Status’ should be set to “Authorization Request Sent”.

Filters for Contact Recipients:

+Audience 1: Authorizers:+
Authorizer contacts related to the account.
_Relationship Flow: Contact > Contact Account Role > Account > Case_
Where Contacts related to the account for the case who have at least one Account-Contact Role with ‘Role’ = “Authorizer” AND have a value in the Contact ‘Email’ field AND Account-Contact Role ‘Status’ = “Active” AND Contact ‘Status’ = “Active”.

+Audience 2: CSMs:+
CSM contacts within the Contract that is related to the organization (child account) that is related to the Case.  

_Relationship Flow: Contact > Customer Enablement Resource > Contract > Account > Case_
Where Customer Enablement Resource ‘Status' = “Active” AND Contact - ‘Email’ contains data.

*Email template logic:*
_Trigger_ - ‘Send Authorization Email’ = “Yes” (toggle that exists on Case) where the Dynamics environment is US.

This logic will go through a CI-J Journey.

This can be triggered multiple times.
